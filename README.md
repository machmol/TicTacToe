# TicTacToe
My First Application

thu 2021-05-11
This is my first, finished little software project.

Simple TicTacToe with a single / multiplayer mode.

I decided on this project to get a better understanding on C#.

- covered derived classes
- while, for, do loops
- Properties
- Collections (List)
